# ZihanZhu_MScproject_Q-A-Dataset
I list all the questions and answers in the QuestionAnswer module of this chatbot: Declaration: The answers to these questions are from Wikipedia, and I add a source of reference after each answer so there is no plagiarism.
What you are viewing is the data set collected by the QuestionAnswer module of this project. All the answers to the questions come from the Internet, these can be Wikipedia. I do not need to modify the data (that is, the answer corresponding to each question), because these data are very authoritative, with rigor and reference value. I quoted their source for each piece of data (each answer), which can be found through the URL at the bottom of the data. Since it is an encyclopedia search, most of the authors do not have the name of the author. I use "Anon" to indicate this phenomenon.
In addition, I show the implementation of the chatbot function. Please check "Chatbot conversation" document.
